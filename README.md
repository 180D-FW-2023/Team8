# Virtual Air Hockey
Note: graphics include flashing colors.
## Overview
This project aims to recreate air hockey virtually using a camera and an integrated IMU
## Instructions
In order to run the game, you need to install ably, pygame, numpy, opencv, and matplotlib.
Use a python command prompt with pip to install these modules.
In the future, this won't be necessary, as the game itself will run on a raspberry pi 4 with all these modules preinstalled.

# Virtual Air Hockey
Note: graphics include flashing colors.
## Overview
This project aims to recreate air hockey virtually using a camera and an integrated IMU

## Requirements
- A camera, preferably one that can be put flush and level with the play surface
- A computer, currently. We were having issues with our raspberry pi 4 installing openCV and other python modules; in the future all that will be necessary will be a monitor and cable to connect the raspberry pi to, but optionally a computer will remain compatible.
- The green Air Hockey Striker with integrated IMU

## Setup
1. Install python on your computer of choice.
*We personally use Anaconda as our package manager

3. Using the python and package manager installation method of your choice, install the following in any order: `ably`, `pygame`, `numpy`, and `opencv-contrib-python`. These installations can be performed by opening up your python command prompt and running pip install followed by the names listed above, one at a time individually.
 * Alternatively, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required dependencies within requirements.txt .
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Clone this repository or download its code.

## Runtime ##
After everything is installed without errors, run `controller.py` to start the game.
```bash
python3 controller.py 
```
## Troubleshooting ##
* OpenCV Issues: If Python is not able to find certain OpenCV modules, try uninstalling and reinstalling OpenCV, ensuring that opencv-contrib-python is the installed package, not   
* Delay/Lag: If you are experiencing lag, try closing other memory intensive applications such as web browsers.
* Unresponsive Key Presses: If you click a key in the menu and the screen does not change, try holding that key instead of tapping it.
* Pygame Window Freezing: The pygame window can freeze on certain machines if you click into it with your mouse. Simply donâ€™t click with your mouse while the game is running. This appears to be a mac vs. windows issue.

## Codebase
![code](https://github.com/180D-FW-2023/Team8/blob/master/assets/code_diagram.png)
Each module is organzied into its own folder. Naviagte to each module's `readme.md` for more information about software details.
